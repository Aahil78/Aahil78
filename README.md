Hi! I'm Aahil. a 14 year old who loves engineering, programming, designing, making, soldering, and more! I run a Hack Club called Cyber Link where I teach students and teenagers robotics and engineering. I want to provide students and teenagers like me with free access to hardware, software, equipment, tools, etc. which is why I also teach for free. It's not registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit yet but it's under Hack Club, which is a registered nonprofit in the U.S.
